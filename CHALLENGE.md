Hi there!
Looks like you already nailed the first interview. This is a small task for you to show off your technical skills to \[redacted\]. We at \[redacted\] love deliciously healthy food. But finding good food is hard. So we want you to build a crowdsourced food rating system. We are sharing some user stories and your goal is to build a small project based on the user stories.
We would like to see this simple project built using Typescript and any full stack framework of your choice. You can use any relational database of your choice. The suggested tech stack is: Remix or a React application using React Router 6.4 for the frontend and Express backend.
We love TDD, simplicity, creativity, and code cleanliness. Make sure to create a descriptive readme.md file and to tidy up your code bases.
User stories

1. As a user I can see the restaurants and their available products, each with the latest review and the average rating, if they exist.
2. As a user I can rate and leave reviews for each restaurant and product.
3. As a user I can filter restaurants based on cuisine. (Optional)
4. As a user I can see all the restaurants I have rated in the past (Optional).
   
Notes:
1. You can ignore user authentication for this task.
2. Please deploy the project and share the link with us.
3. You can be as creative as you want, especially regarding the UI.
4. Feel free to contact us with any questions you might have.
   Submission:
   Please create a GitHub repository to store your project. Email the GitHub link with any supporting material to tech_recruiting@\[redacted\].co. If you can deploy your project for us to test ‘in the wild’, then we would be more than happy to test this as well. Please submit this project within one week of receiving this task.
